							<p class="projectDescription">
								Welcome to Week 2, during which we will gain some practical skills regarding the creation of flow charts. 
								These are used during the design stage of the SDLC and can be used from that point onwards to support 
								communications between stakeholders.
							</p>
								<br>

							<h3 class="projectSub">In this unit we shall:</h3>
								<br>
								<ul class="projectDescription">
									<li>Gain an awareness of the opportunities for integrating software security development practices at each stage of the agile SDLC.</li>
									<li>Experiment with the creation of UML flow charts.</li>
									<li>Understand the range of ways in which software security can be problematic.</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
							<h3 class="projectSub">On completion of this unit you will be able to:</h3>
								<br>
								<ul class="projectDescription">
									<li>Research the academic literature on software development which follows an agile process and prioritises security.</li>
									<li>Break down the steps involved in a process so that they may be represented as a flow chart.</li>
									<li>Reading areas of an ISO/IEC Standard on security and becoming familiar with the language and concepts.</li>

								<span class="dropcap">T</span>he International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27000 standard's "Terms and Definitions" section offers 
								a comprehensive vocabulary for managing internal cybersecurity risks. Access control, awareness, 
								information security incident management, and risk assessment can help mitigate internal cybersecurity threats. 
								By integrating these measures, organizations can transform their workforce into an asset in the fight against cyber threats.
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Indicators:</strong><br>
								A common tenet in the ‘Lean Six Sigma’ methodology is that what isn't measured isn't improved, 
								highlighting the importance of indicators in driving improvements. A recent study from Chaudhary, 
								Gkioulos and Katsikas (2022) emphasizes that evaluating cybersecurity awareness programs involves 
								measuring factors like behaviour, attitude, and knowledge, using methods such as surveys and 
								statistical analysis of passive data to ensure comprehensive and effective assessments.
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Access Control:</strong><br>
								Implementing robust access control measures is crucial for securing sensitive information by 
								ensuring only authorized individuals have access. Techniques include using strong authentication 
								methods and maintaining detailed records of access permissions. According to Putra and 
								Surantha (2019), integrating Network Access Control (NAC) with an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
								can effectively mitigate internal user attacks.
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Awareness:</strong><br>
								Building a culture of security awareness is another vital element. This involves continuous education 
								about potential cybersecurity threats and the importance of security protocols. Awareness campaigns 
								can keep cybersecurity at the forefront of employees' minds, making them less likely to inadvertently 
								become vectors for security breaches (Corradini, 2020).
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Information Security Incident Management:</strong><br>
								Should a security breach occur, having a robust incident management process is essential. 
								According to a study by Ahmad et al. (2020), integrating information security management and incident 
								response functions can significantly enhance an organization's ability to learn from incidents and 
								improve its overall security posture.
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Risk Assessment:</strong><br>
								Regular risk assessments can identify potential internal threats before they become actual breaches. 
								These assessments need to take into account both technical vulnerabilities and human factors that could 
								contribute to security risks. According to a study by Fanni Zsuzsanna Gozon, Vaczi and Edit 
								Toth-Laufer (2021), incorporating human factors into cybersecurity risk assessments using a fuzzy-based 
								model can significantly improve the prediction and management of these risks.
