									Evaluation of this Unit's Assesment:
								</h3>
							</header>
							<p class="projectDescription">
								Implementing the driverless car system in Unit 11 transformed the system design from Unit 7 into a reality. 
								The shift from planning the system to actually implementing it enhanced my grasp of object oriented programming (OOP) principles.
								<br>
								The task aimed to write Python code that mirrors the UML diagrams created earlier in unit 7, 
								incorporating adjustments based on feedback or further reflection. Going through this process made me realize how software development is a journey
								 where initial plans evolve to address implementation obstacles.
								<br>
								A notable change was opting to exclude the Coordinate class from the design. This decision streamlined the system's 
								structure making it more transparent and efficient. This adjustment simplified managing the vehicles position and 
								reduced the complexity of interactions among different components.
								<br>
								Building the system highlighted the balance between creating designs and integrating them into a cohesive system. 
								Classes like EnvironmentalDataSimulator and SensorManager played roles in simulating how the car interacts with its surroundings. 
								The challenge lay in ensuring these elements functioned smoothly together. Working on the ObstacleDetector class and its ethical 
								considerations surrounding decision making brought a level of complexity to the implementation phase.
								<br>
								Additionaly, after going through lesson 9 on packaging Python code, I was uncertain if spliting my program into 
								multiple modules was the right option. The classes seemed too interconnected and the entire program didn't seem long enough to justify packaging.
								<br>
								Testing was also an important part of this assesment. By using assert statements in Python I methodically tested 
								each components functionality ranging from data generation and processing to how the car responded to cues. 
								This method ensured the systems reliability and deepened my understanding of automated testing practices and their significance in software development.

								<h2 class="projectA">Summative Assessment</h2>
								<p class="projectDescriptionBlack">
									Assessment instructions:<br>
									"You are now required to implement the code designed to support the operation of a driverless car as described in Unit 7. 
									This should be representative of the use case diagram, activity diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, and state 
									transition diagram defined in your design document. Please do modify any of the diagrammatic capabilities 
									in response to advancements in your thought process since the design document was submitted, or in response to feedback received.
									<br>
									All code scripts must be documented, explained, and follow best practices. 
									You should ensure that your code is fully tested and provide evidence of your testing. 
									Use Python's assert statement to achieve automated testing, in addition to any other types of testing you believe are useful in this deployment.
									<br>
									Additionally, you should submit a commentary evaluating your approach and reflecting on the development process. 
									This commentary should also be part of your README file/documentation (600 words)."
