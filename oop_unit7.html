									Evaluation of this Unit's Assesment:
								</h3>
							</header>
							<p class="projectDescription">
								This Unit 7 assignment was an eye opening exploration of developing a system for an autonomous car. 
								The project involved designing a system that merged object oriented programming principles with the requirements of driverless vehicles, 
								particularly focusing on three chosen operations: obstacle detection and avoidance, traffic signs recognition, and automated parking. 
								Transitioning from using Microsoft Visio to Whimsical for creating diagrams marked a shift by introducing a more user friendly interface for 
								creating the necessary UML diagrams for this assignment. This heightened the quality and clarity of my designs.
								<br><br>
								Designing this system model presented its own set of challenges. Ensuring that all classes not only fulfilled their individual functions 
								but also was designed to interact seamlessly was a test of both my understanding of object-oriented concepts and my ability to foresee operational scenarios. 
								Visualizing how these theoretical designs could be implemented was challenging as well. The need to work with data structures such as lists, stacks,
								 queues and dictionaries pushed me to think about data retention and manipulation in a dynamic, real-time environment.
								<br><br>
								During this assignment, I developed a deeper understanding of the complexity involved in designing a software for self-driving vehicles. 
								This project also pushed me to consider the practical consequences of my design decisions. Mastering the use of a new UML design tool turned out 
								to be a skill that allowed me to visually communicate complex ideas effectively. This project has undeniably enhanced my problem-solving skills and
								 design thinking which are essential for my pursuits in software engineering.

										Assessment instructions:<br>
										"A Design Proposal of Software to Support Operation of a Driverless Car<br>
										As a Software Engineer, you are given the role of designing the software which supports the operation of a self-driving car. 
										In your research around the capabilities of self-driving cars, you can search for keywords that include autonomous vehicle, driverless car, robotic car.
										<br>
										You are required to identify three operations that you wish to support in your software and provision capability for them through
										 the use of an object-oriented Python program. The system should support the ability for a customer to interact with the system through a front-end.
										<br>
										Running in the system back-end should be a capability that simulates the generation and collection of data attributes that represent the 
										wider environment within which the driverless car is operating.
