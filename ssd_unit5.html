							<p class="projectDescriptionBlack">

								<span class="dropcap">T</span>his week, we were given a piece of code that seemed quite complex 
								at first glance. It involved partitioning a collection of integers into equivalence 
								classes based on a specific relation. At first, it felt a bit overwhelming, but as I explored it, 
								I started to get a better understanding of it.
								<br><br>
								The main function, `equivalence_partition`, takes objects and a relation that defines when two 
								objects are equivalent. It then groups these objects into sets where all members of a set are 
								equivalent. Another function, `equivalence_enumeration`, does the same thing but also numbers each 
								equivalence class, which is useful to keep track of the groups with identifiers. There’s also 
								`check_equivalence_partition,` which makes sure the partitioning is done correctly, and a test 
								function that shows how this works with numbers.
								<br><br>
								To really understand it, I decided to tweak the code a bit. I wrote a new test function that 
								partitions a list of strings based on their lengths. In this new test function, I created a 
								relation that says two strings are equivalent if they have the same length. Then, I used this 
								relation to partition a list of fruit names. Finally, I printed out the equivalence classes and 
								how each string maps to its class.
								<br><br>
								Here's the changes I've made, for exploration purposes:
							</p>
								<br>
								<br>

									<code class="language-py">
										def equivalence_partition(iterable, relation):

												iterable: collection of objects to be partitioned

													if and only if o1 and o2 are equivalent

											Returns: classes, partitions
												classes: A sequence of sets. Each one is an equivalence class
												partitions: A dictionary mapping objects to equivalence classes
											"""
											classes = []
											partitions = {}
											for o in iterable:  # for each object

												found = False
												for c in classes:
													if relation(next(iter(c)), o):  # is it equivalent to this class?
														c.add(o)
														partitions[o] = c
														found = True
														break
												if not found:  # it is in a new class
													classes.append(set([o]))
													partitions[o] = classes[-1]
											return classes, partitions


										def equivalence_enumeration(iterable, relation):
											"""Partitions a set of objects into equivalence classes

											Same as equivalence_partition() but also numbers the classes.

												classes: A sequence of sets. Each one is an equivalence class
												partitions: A dictionary mapping objects to equivalence classes

											classes, partitions = equivalence_partition(iterable, relation)
											ids = {}
											for i, c in enumerate(classes):
												for o in c:
													ids[o] = i
											return classes, partitions, ids


										def check_equivalence_partition(classes, partitions, relation):
											"""Checks that a partition is consistent under the relationship"""
											for o, c in partitions.items():
												for _c in classes:
													assert (o in _c) ^ (not _c is c)
											for c1 in classes:
												for o1 in c1:
													for c2 in classes:
														for o2 in c2:
															assert (c1 is c2) ^ (not relation(o1, o2))


										def test_equivalence_partition():
											relation = lambda x, y: (x - y) % 4 == 0
											classes, partitions = equivalence_partition(
												range(-3, 5),
												relation
											)
											check_equivalence_partition(classes, partitions, relation)
											for c in classes: print(c)
											for o, c in partitions.items(): print(o, ':', c)


										def test_equivalence_partition_strings():
											"""Partitions a list of strings into equivalence classes based on their lengths"""
											relation = lambda x, y: len(x) == len(y)
											strings = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig", "grape"]
											classes, partitions = equivalence_partition(strings, relation)
											check_equivalence_partition(classes, partitions, relation)
											for c in classes: print(c)
											for o, c in partitions.items(): print(o, ':', c)

							<h3 class="projectA" style="background-color: black; line-height: normal">Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today</h3>
							<p class="projectDescriptionBlack">
								Activity instructions:
								<br>
								The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of 
								code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? 
								Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software?
							</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p class="unit_activity">
								<span class="dropcap">C</span>yclomatic Complexity, while just a metric, is a valuable indicator of how well a 
								developer adheres to best practices. High complexity often points to code that is hard to 
								understand and test, which increases the risk of security vulnerabilities. Complex code 
								paths are harder to analyze and secure. So, even though it's just one metric, keeping 
								Cyclomatic Complexity low is a good practice to reduce risks and maintain secure, 
								reliable software. Other metrics like Cognitive Complexity are also relevant for secure 
								development, as they assess the readability and maintainability of code, ensuring that 
								it is not only structurally sound but also easy for developers to understand and modify 
								safely. This can impact not only the software’s security but also the development and 
								maintenance costs, as simpler, more understandable code is generally less expensive to 
								manage and update.
